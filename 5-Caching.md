# Caching in Snowflake

Caching is a key feature of Snowflake's architecture that improves performance, reduces query latency, and optimizes resource utilization. Snowflake employs multiple caching mechanisms at different layers to ensure that frequently accessed data is retrieved quickly, without having to re-execute expensive queries or reload data from storage.

## Caching Layers by Cache Location

### Query Result Cache (Services Layer)

-   **Location**: Stored in the **Services Layer**, which is part of Snowflake’s control plane.
-   **Purpose**: Caches the results of previously executed queries.
-   **Details**:
    -   Independent of virtual warehouses.
    -   Persists even if the warehouse is suspended or resized.
    -   Stored in Snowflake’s managed infrastructure (not on the customer’s compute or storage).


### Warehouse Cache (Virtual Warehouse)

-   **Location**: Stored in the **local disk** of the virtual warehouse (compute layer).
-   **Purpose**: Caches data read from storage to avoid repeated reads.
-   **Details**:
    -   Valid only within the same virtual warehouse.
    -   Cleared when the warehouse is resized or suspended.
    -   Includes frequently accessed or reused data during query execution.


### Metadata Cache (Services Layer)

-   **Location**: Stored in the **Services Layer**.
-   **Purpose**: Caches metadata about tables, schemas, and query execution plans.
-   **Details**:
    -   Helps accelerate query planning and optimization.
    -   Includes column statistics, table structure, and other metadata for efficient query parsing.


### Data Pruning and Micro-Partition Metadata Cache (Storage Layer)

-   **Location**: Cached in Snowflake’s **storage layer**, typically hosted on **cloud storage services** like AWS S3, Azure Blob Storage, or Google Cloud Storage.
-   **Purpose**: Caches micro-partition metadata to optimize query performance by pruning irrelevant data.
-   **Details**:
    -   Enables Snowflake to identify and access only the relevant micro-partitions for a query.
    -   Does not involve reloading entire data partitions unless needed.

### Materialized View Cache (Services and Storage Layers)

-   **Location**: Stored in both the **Services Layer** (for query access) and the **Storage Layer** (as pre-computed results).
-   **Purpose**: Caches pre-computed results of complex queries defined in materialized views.
-   **Details**:
    -   Automatically refreshed based on changes to the underlying data.
    -   Provides fast access to pre-computed results.



## Caching Layer by Cache Type

### Query Result Cache

The **Query Result Cache** stores the results of previously executed queries and allows Snowflake to quickly retrieve these results without re-running the query. This cache is especially beneficial when the same query is executed multiple times, either by the same or different users.

#### How Query Result Cache Works

-   **Cache Storage:** When a query is executed for the first time, Snowflake processes it, stores the results in the result cache, and serves the results to the user. The results are then stored in a **cache** for a period of time.
-   **Cache Lookup:** If the same query is executed again (with the same parameters and structure), Snowflake can simply retrieve the results from the cache, bypassing the need to recompute the results from scratch.
-   **Cache Validity:** The cache is **time-bound** and is invalidated in the following cases:
    -   The underlying data has changed (e.g., data updates, deletes, inserts).
    -   The query or its structure is altered.
    -   The session expires or the warehouse is suspended.

#### Benefits

-   **Speed**: Subsequent executions of the same query are served directly from the cache, drastically reducing query times.
-   **Cost Efficiency**: Reduces the need for compute resources, thus lowering the cost of query execution.
-   **Optimization**: Helps in scenarios where identical queries are run frequently.

#### Cache Lifetime and Invalidations

-   The result cache is valid until one of the invalidation conditions is met, such as changes to the data in the underlying tables or the modification of the query itself.
-   Result cache duration can vary but is typically retained for a **24-hour period**, after which the cache is cleared.

### Warehouse Cache (Local Disk Cache)

Snowflake also caches data at the **warehouse** level in the form of **local disk cache**. When a virtual warehouse executes a query, it stores data in memory and on the local disk. This data is kept in cache across all subsequent queries executed on the same warehouse, which improves performance by avoiding repeated data loading.

#### How Warehouse Cache Works

-   **Local Storage of Results**: When a query is executed, the results are cached at the virtual warehouse level. The data required for the query is stored in the warehouse’s **local disk cache**, which makes it faster for the warehouse to access the data for subsequent queries.
-   **Data Reuse**: If the same data is required for multiple queries, Snowflake can retrieve it from the local cache instead of reading it from the storage layer.
-   **Automatic Cache Management**: Snowflake automatically manages this cache, and it will purge cached data based on space or time limitations.

#### Benefits

-   **Query Performance**: Reduces the time to retrieve data, especially for repeated queries with overlapping data.
-   **Cost Reduction**: Decreases compute resource consumption by reducing I/O operations and repeated data retrieval from storage.
-   **Parallel Query Processing**: Data cached at the warehouse level can also improve parallel processing efficiency for large queries.

#### Cache Invalidations

-   The cache is invalidated when the underlying data changes (due to **insertions**, **deletions**, or **updates**) or when a new query requiring different data is executed.

### Metadata Cache

The **Metadata Cache** stores metadata about the tables, schemas, and query execution plans, which is important for Snowflake's **query optimization**. The metadata is used to speed up query execution, as the system can avoid re-scanning or recalculating metadata for queries that reference the same objects.

#### How Metadata Cache Works

-   **Table Metadata**: When a query is executed, Snowflake caches metadata about the table structure, such as column names, data types, indexes, and partition information.
-   **Execution Plans**: Snowflake caches the execution plans generated for queries, so that it can quickly reuse them for similar queries, reducing the time spent on query planning and optimization.

#### Benefits

-   **Reduced Overhead**: The query planning and metadata retrieval process is sped up because the system does not need to repeatedly fetch metadata from storage or recompile execution plans.
-   **Faster Query Parsing**: Reduces the time spent on parsing and planning for frequently executed queries.

#### Cache Invalidations

-   Metadata is invalidated when there are changes to the schema, tables, or objects referenced in the query. If the table schema changes (e.g., adding/removing columns), Snowflake clears the metadata cache for that table.

### Data Caching in Storage

Data caching at the **storage layer** in Snowflake happens when the same data is frequently accessed across queries, and it is cached in Snowflake’s **internal storage layer**. Snowflake stores data in **micro-partitions**, and data that is frequently accessed can be retrieved quickly from these partitions after an initial access.

#### How Data Caching in Storage Works

-   **Micro-partitioning**: When data is queried from Snowflake, it reads the relevant micro-partitions. Data that is accessed multiple times gets cached at the storage layer, making it faster to retrieve the next time.
-   **Data Pruning**: When queries filter on specific data, Snowflake uses its **pruning** mechanisms to skip unnecessary micro-partitions and reduce the amount of data to be loaded from storage.

#### Benefits

-   **Efficient Data Access**: Frequently accessed data can be read faster without needing to be fetched from disk multiple times.
-   **Reduced Storage I/O**: Snowflake minimizes the time and resources spent reading data from external storage systems, such as Amazon S3, by caching data in its own optimized storage layer.

#### **Cache Invalidations:**

-   Data cache is invalidated when data is updated, deleted, or inserted into the table. In such cases, Snowflake ensures that only the latest versions of the data are cached and returned in queries.


### Materialized Views and Result Caching

In addition to the general query and warehouse caching, **materialized views** also help in caching the results of **complex queries**. Materialized views are pre-computed query results stored as objects, and they are refreshed periodically or when the underlying data changes.

#### How Materialized View Caching Works

-   When a **materialized view** is created, it stores the results of a complex query.
-   Subsequent queries that reference the materialized view fetch precomputed data rather than re-running the complex query, speeding up performance.
-   Materialized views are automatically refreshed in the background to keep them up-to-date with the source tables.

#### Benefits

-   **Faster Query Performance**: Complex aggregations or joins can be pre-computed, drastically reducing query execution time.
-   **Reduced Load on Compute Resources**: Since the results are already stored, Snowflake can avoid recomputing large or complex queries.

#### Cache Invalidations

-   The cache for a materialized view is invalidated when the underlying data is updated or when the view itself is refreshed.

## Cache Management and Cost Efficiency

Snowflake’s cache management is designed to be **automatic**, reducing the need for users to manually manage cached data. Caching optimizes resource usage by minimizing repetitive computations and reducing the need to read data from the cloud storage.

### Benefits of Cache Management

-   **Cost Reduction**: Caching reduces the need for expensive storage I/O and repeated computations, which lowers the overall cost of data processing.
-   **Performance Boost**: Cached data is fetched much faster than fresh data, which accelerates query performance, especially in high-concurrency scenarios.
-   **Resource Efficiency**: Snowflake's cache management mechanisms free up compute resources by avoiding unnecessary query re-execution.
