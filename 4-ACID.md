# ACID in Snowflake
Snowflake provides **ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability)** compliance by leveraging a combination of architectural design, transaction management, and robust processing mechanisms. Here's a detailed explanation of how Snowflake ensures each of the ACID properties:


## Transactions in Snowflake

A **transaction** in Snowflake is a logical unit of work that groups one or more SQL statements together. Transactions ensure that these grouped operations are executed as a single, atomic action, adhering to the principles of **ACID** (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability).

### How Transactions Work in Snowflake

1.  **Starting a Transaction**:
    
    -   Transactions begin implicitly when the first DML (Data Manipulation Language) statement, such as `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE`, is executed.
    -   Alternatively, transactions can be explicitly started with the `BEGIN` command.
2.  **Commit and Rollback**:
    
    -   **`COMMIT`**: Permanently saves the changes made by the transaction.
    -   **`ROLLBACK`**: Undoes all changes made during the transaction, restoring the database to its previous state.
3.  **Implicit Commit**:
    
    -   Some operations, such as DDL (Data Definition Language) commands like `CREATE` or `DROP`, include an implicit commit, meaning they cannot be rolled back.
4.  **Transaction Scope**:
    
    -   Transactions are session-specific, meaning they are confined to the session where they are initiated.


### Best Practices for Using Transactions

1.  **Keep Transactions Short**:
    
    -   Minimize the duration of transactions to avoid locking resources and reduce the likelihood of conflicts with other operations.
2.  **Use Explicit Transactions**:
    
    -   Clearly define the start and end of transactions using `BEGIN`, `COMMIT`, and `ROLLBACK` for better control and readability.
3.  **Handle Errors Gracefully**:
    
    -   Implement error-handling mechanisms to roll back transactions when issues occur.
4.  **Be Aware of Implicit Commits**:
    
    -   Understand which commands trigger implicit commits to avoid unintended data persistence.


### Benefits of Transactions in Snowflake

-   **Data Integrity**: Transactions maintain the consistency and reliability of the database.
-   **Error Recovery**: The ability to roll back ensures the system can recover from errors without manual intervention.
-   **Concurrency Management**: Isolation ensures that concurrent users can perform operations without interference.


## Atomicity

Atomicity ensures that database transactions are processed entirely or not at all. In other words, if a transaction is interrupted (e.g., due to a crash or failure), any changes made are rolled back, and the database remains in a consistent state.

### How Snowflake Ensures Atomicity

-   **Transactional Handling**: Snowflake uses **multi-version concurrency control (MVCC)** to track all versions of a data object, ensuring that all operations within a transaction are either fully committed or fully rolled back.
-   **Transactional Control**: If a query or operation fails, Snowflake will ensure that any changes made during the transaction are **reversed**. The system uses its **transaction log** to keep track of operations, making sure the state of the database is consistent.

### Example

When multiple operations are executed as part of a single transaction (e.g., inserting data into multiple tables), if any one operation fails, all other changes will be rolled back, ensuring the transaction is atomic.


## Consistency

Consistency guarantees that a transaction will bring the database from one valid state to another. Any data written to the database must be valid according to the defined rules, such as constraints, triggers, and cascades.

### How Snowflake Ensures Consistency

-   **Data Integrity**: Snowflake ensures that data written into the database adheres to constraints like **primary keys**, **foreign keys**, and **check constraints**. If data is inconsistent or violates integrity rules, the transaction will fail.
-   **Schema Consistency**: Snowflake enforces **schema consistency** by maintaining metadata about the tables, schemas, and databases. Transactions that modify schema objects (e.g., adding columns) are handled with strict validation to ensure that they don’t violate schema rules.

### Example

Suppose a database has a table with a unique constraint on a column. If a transaction tries to insert duplicate data into this column, Snowflake will reject the transaction, ensuring the integrity of the data is maintained.

## Isolation

Isolation ensures that the execution of one transaction is isolated from the execution of other concurrent transactions. This prevents **dirty reads**, **non-repeatable reads**, and **phantom reads**.

### How Snowflake Ensures Isolation

-   **Multi-Version Concurrency Control (MVCC)**: Snowflake employs **MVCC** to manage concurrent read and write operations. MVCC maintains **multiple versions** of data in the database, ensuring that a transaction sees a consistent snapshot of data. This prevents transactions from interfering with each other.
    
-   **Read Consistency**: Each transaction gets its **own snapshot** of data, ensuring that it doesn’t see any intermediate changes made by other transactions. This provides **serializability** (the highest isolation level) by ensuring that transactions appear to be executed sequentially.
    
-   **Concurrency Control**: Snowflake uses **transaction timestamps** to ensure that queries do not interfere with each other, maintaining a consistent and isolated environment for each transaction.
    

### Example

If two users are querying and updating the same data at the same time, Snowflake ensures that the changes from one transaction do not interfere with the other. Even if they execute concurrently, each will see the data in its own state, preventing **dirty reads**.


## Durability

Durability ensures that once a transaction has been committed, it will remain persistent in the database, even in the event of a system crash or failure. The changes made by committed transactions are not lost.

### How Snowflake Ensures Durability

-   **Write-Ahead Logging (WAL)**: Snowflake employs a **write-ahead log (WAL)** for all transactions. This means that before changes are written to the data store, they are first recorded in a transaction log. In the event of a failure, the system can recover by replaying the transaction log.
    
-   **Automatic Backups**: Snowflake provides **automatic backups** of data in the cloud storage, using the underlying cloud provider’s durability features (e.g., **AWS S3**, **Azure Blob Storage**, or **Google Cloud Storage**). These backups are consistent, and Snowflake can restore data from these backups if needed.
    
-   **Data Replication and Fault Tolerance**: Snowflake automatically replicates data across multiple availability zones in the cloud infrastructure to ensure that data is available even if one zone becomes unavailable. This replication adds a layer of durability to ensure that committed transactions are not lost.
    

### Example

Even if a system failure or crash occurs immediately after a transaction is committed, the transaction will still be durable, as it will be safely stored in the **WAL** and replicated to other locations in the cloud. After recovery, the committed transaction will be intact.


## Snowflake's Approach to ACID Compliance

-   **Transaction Management**: Snowflake uses **ACID-compliant transaction processing** via a combination of MVCC, write-ahead logs, and strict concurrency controls. This guarantees that even complex workloads or high concurrency scenarios won’t compromise the consistency or integrity of the database.
    
-   **Multi-Version Concurrency Control (MVCC)**: MVCC is a key feature for achieving isolation, as it enables concurrent read and write operations without locking. Each transaction operates on its own snapshot of the data, which is stored as a versioned record.
    
-   **Zero Downtime Recovery**: Snowflake's architecture ensures **zero-downtime recovery** in case of failures. This includes **automatic failover** between regions, **replication**, and **backup management** that ensures data durability even in cases of disaster recovery scenarios.
    
-   **Time Travel and Fail-safe**: Snowflake provides **Time Travel** and **Fail-safe** features that allow users to query historical versions of data or recover data after a failure. Time Travel can be configured up to 90 days, ensuring that even if an operation is accidentally performed (e.g., data deletion), it can be undone.
    

**Multi-Version Concurrency Control (MVCC)** is a crucial mechanism used in Snowflake to manage concurrent access to data while ensuring consistency, isolation, and overall system performance. MVCC allows multiple transactions to be processed simultaneously without conflicting with each other, ensuring that each transaction works on a consistent snapshot of data.

## How MVCC Works in Snowflake

MVCC works by maintaining **multiple versions of data**. When a transaction starts, it sees a snapshot of the database at the exact moment it began. Even if other transactions modify the same data during the transaction’s execution, the first transaction continues to work with its own version of the data, ensuring **isolation** from other transactions.


### Key Principles of MVCC in Snowflake

1.  **Snapshot Isolation**:
    
    -   Each transaction operates on a **snapshot** of the database that is isolated from the changes made by other transactions.
    -   When a transaction begins, it takes a **consistent snapshot** of the data. Any changes made by other concurrent transactions during the execution of the transaction are not visible to the running transaction.
    -   This prevents issues like **dirty reads** (reading uncommitted data) and ensures that each transaction operates as if it were the only one running at that time.
2.  **Multiple Versions of Data**:
    
    -   Snowflake creates **multiple versions** of each data record. Each version of a record corresponds to a **different transaction** that modified the record.
    -   These versions are timestamped and tagged to indicate when they were created and which transaction modified them.
    -   This enables Snowflake to maintain consistency even in the presence of concurrent transactions by ensuring that each transaction sees its own version of the data.
3.  **Transaction Timestamps**:
    
    -   Every transaction is assigned a unique **timestamp** or **transaction ID** when it begins.
    -   These timestamps are used to **track visibility** of data versions. When a transaction accesses a record, it will only see the version of that record that was committed at or before its own transaction timestamp.
4.  **Read and Write Consistency**:
    
    -   **Reads**: A transaction can only read data that was committed before its own timestamp. It will never see data from another uncommitted transaction.
    -   **Writes**: When a transaction modifies data, it creates a new version of the data without overwriting the old version. This ensures that other transactions can continue to operate on the old version of the data until the new version is committed.
5.  **Garbage Collection**:
    
    -   When a transaction commits and its changes are no longer needed by other transactions, Snowflake will **garbage collect** or remove old versions of data to free up storage.
    -   Snowflake performs this cleanup in the background, ensuring that only the most recent versions of data are kept active.

### **MVCC in Action: Example**

Let’s walk through an example to understand how MVCC works in practice:

1.  **Transaction A** starts and retrieves a snapshot of the database. It sees the current state of the data at the time the transaction begins (e.g., `data_version_1`).
    
2.  **Transaction B** starts at the same time and also retrieves a snapshot. It sees the data as it was at the moment **Transaction B** started (e.g., `data_version_2`).
    
3.  Both **Transaction A** and **Transaction B** can make changes to the data. For instance, Transaction A may update a record, creating **`data_version_3`**, while Transaction B may update the same record, creating **`data_version_4`**.
    
4.  When **Transaction A** commits, the system stores **`data_version_3`** as the most recent version of the data. However, **Transaction B** does not see these changes until it is finished and sees its own snapshot version of the data.
    
5.  When **Transaction B** commits, **`data_version_4`** is stored, and the previous version (e.g., `data_version_3`) is no longer needed unless it’s still required by other transactions or systems.
    
6.  **Transaction A** and **Transaction B** are isolated from each other’s changes until they commit. Each transaction operates on its own version of the data, ensuring **serializability** and **isolation**.


### Advantages of MVCC in Snowflake

1.  **Concurrency**:
    
    -   MVCC allows for high concurrency by enabling multiple transactions to work simultaneously on different versions of data without blocking each other. This is particularly beneficial in analytical systems like Snowflake, where multiple users or processes might query or modify large amounts of data at the same time.
2.  **Isolation**:
    
    -   With MVCC, Snowflake ensures that each transaction works in isolation, preventing conflicts between concurrent operations. This is crucial for preventing **dirty reads** and **non-repeatable reads**, thus providing **serializability** (the highest isolation level).
3.  **Consistency**:
    
    -   MVCC maintains a consistent view of the database for each transaction, regardless of what other transactions are doing. This prevents issues like **phantom reads** (where a transaction sees different results due to concurrent inserts or deletes) and ensures that data integrity is maintained.
4.  **Performance**:
    
    -   MVCC allows for **non-blocking reads**, meaning that read queries can run without waiting for write operations to complete. This increases overall system performance and reduces latency.
5.  **No Locks**:
    
    -   MVCC eliminates the need for locking mechanisms (e.g., row-level locks), which often create contention and performance bottlenecks in traditional relational databases.


### Challenges and Considerations with MVCC in Snowflake

1.  **Storage Overhead**:
    
    -   Since MVCC creates multiple versions of data, this can increase storage requirements, particularly when there are frequent updates to the data. Snowflake automatically handles garbage collection and pruning of obsolete versions, but in certain scenarios (like long-running transactions), storage usage may increase temporarily.
2.  **Garbage Collection and Versioning**:
    
    -   While Snowflake manages garbage collection in the background, older data versions must be retained until all transactions that need them have been completed. This means there may be a small delay in cleaning up old versions of data.
3.  **Complexity in Large-Scale Transactions**:
    
    -   In high-concurrency scenarios with frequent updates and deletions, MVCC requires careful management of data versions to avoid excessive version accumulation. Snowflake’s architecture handles this efficiently, but users may still encounter performance issues in extreme cases if not managed properly.
